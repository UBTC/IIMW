# xubuntu.confs

Inheriting the previous version of [IIMW](https://code.google.com/p/iimw/), this repository collects scripts which are used for setting up my [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/).

Desktop applications:
- win manager: [openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page)
- dock: [plank](http://wiki.go-docky.com/index.php?title=Plank:Introduction)
- text editor: [neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- shell: [fish](http://fishshell.com/)
- others are mostly [Xubuntu](https://www.xubuntu.org) applications

This repository depends on the following repositories:
- [boxer](https://github.com/mogeiwang/boxer) for setting up openbox window manager
- [goFish](https://github.com/mogeiwang/goFish) for setting up fish-shell and [golang](https://golang.org/)
- [wipy](https://github.com/mogeiwang/wipy) for setting up [ipython](http://ipython.org/)
- [vine](https://github.com/mogeiwang/vine) for setting up neovim editor

The following repositories may also help:
- [fmonad](https://github.com/mogeiwang/fmonad) for setting up [xmonad window manager](http://xmonad.org/)
- [v-p-e](https://github.com/mogeiwang/vim-plus-emacs) for setting up [emacs editor](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

NOTE: scripts in the subdirs are merely for backup. They are *NOT* used in setting up.

M.W.
