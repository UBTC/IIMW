# IIMW

Inheriting the previous version of [IIMW](https://code.google.com/p/iimw/), this repository collects scripts which are used for setting up my [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/).

Languages
- [goFish](https://github.com/ubtc/goFish) for setting up [fish](http://fishshell.com/) and [golang](https://golang.org/)
- [wipy](https://github.com/ubtc/wipy) for setting up [ipython](http://ipython.org/)

Win manager
- [boxer](https://github.com/ubtc/boxer) for setting up [openbox window manager](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page)
- [monadic](https://github.com/ubtc/monadic) for setting up [xmonad window manager](http://xmonad.org/)

Dock
- zero configuration for [plank](http://wiki.go-docky.com/index.php?title=Plank:Introduction)

Text editor
- [vine](https://github.com/ubtc/vine) for setting up [neovim editor](https://neovim.io/)
- [vpEMacs](https://github.com/ubtc/vpEmacs) for setting up [emacs editor](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

Others applications are mostly [Xubuntu](https://www.xubuntu.org), and may switch to [Lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net/) later.

NOTE: scripts in the subdirs are merely for backup. They are `NOT` used in setting up.

M.W.
