# xubuntu.confs

Here collects scripts for setting up my Ubuntu, inheriting the previous version [IIMW](https://code.google.com/p/iimw/).

- win manager: openbox
- dock: plank
- text editor: neovim
- shell: fish
- others are mostly [Xubuntu](https://www.xubuntu.org) applications

Currently, this repository depends on the following repositories:
- [boxer](https://github.com/mogeiwang/boxer)
- [goFish](https://github.com/mogeiwang/goFish)
- [wipy](https://github.com/mogeiwang/wipy)
- [vine](https://github.com/mogeiwang/vine)
- [vim-plus-emacs](https://github.com/mogeiwang/vim-plus-emacs)

NOTE: scripts in the subdirs are merely for backup. They are *NOT* used in setting up.

M.W.
